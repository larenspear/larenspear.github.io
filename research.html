<h1>Research</h1>

<p>I have a lot of diverse areas I've done research work in. In some way, they all tie back to computation. Here are some of my favorites:</p>

<h2>Computational Materials (2017-2020)</h2>

<p>I started work in the Computational Materials lab under Dr. Juliana R. Duncan in Spring of 2017. Throughout my time in the lab,
I worked on density functional theory simulations of bimetallic nanomaterials. This is where I got my start writing Python and where
I discovered my love for programming.</p>

<p>Although we never published a paper, I often went around the conference circuit to present the group's research. I even won a few awards!</p>  


<p>Presentations:</p>
    <p><b>Spear, L.</b> Reactivity and Tunability of Bimetallic Materials. Poster presentation at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) Symposium for Texas Researchers. September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2019; Austin, TX.</p>
    <p><b>Spear, L.</b> Reactivity and Tunability of Bimetallic Materials. Poster presentation at the UTSA College of Sciences Research Conference. October 5th, 2018; San Antonio, TX <b><i>Winner of the best visiting student award</i></b></p>
    <p><b>Spear, L.</b> Reactivity and Tunability of Bimetallic Materials.  Oral presention presented at the Fall Undergraduate Research Forum at UT Austin.  September 29<sup>th</sup>, 2018; Austin, TX. <b><i>Winner for the best chemistry presentation</i></b></p>
    <p><b>Edmonds, G., Spear, L., Olivares, K., and Sun, R.</b> Reactivity and Tunability of Bimetallic Materials. Poster session presented at the Undergraduate Research Forum at UT Austin.  April 13<sup>th</sup>, 2018; Austin, TX.</p>

<h2>Digital Humanities</h2>

<p>What can I say, I'm a nerd for datasets. In Spring 2020 I took a class with Liz Fischer called "Intro to Digital Humanities." For my final project, I did a so-called "distant reading" analysis of Fidel Castro's speeches using R.

<p>In Spring 2021 I continued my DH study, working for Dr. Daniel Birkholz in the Medieval Data Research Lab (MDRL). The lab studies the life of Roger de Breynton, an obscure figure hailing from thirteenth century Hereford, England, and uses digital tools to reconstruct his life from the limited extant records.

<h2>Cybersecurity Policy</h2>

<p>In Spring 2021, I took a class at UT called "STEM for National Security" with Dr. Bianca Adair in which students worked with a mentor to research issues facing the United States and come up with solutions to address them. My group studied vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity policy of the United States.</p>
