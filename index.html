    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I am a first year master's student in computer science at Texas A&amp;M University.</p>

    <p>
        I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in chemistry in 2021. I started programming in
        the computational materials lab as part of the Freshman Research Initiative program (FRI) under Dr. Juliana R. Duncan.
        I primarily worked with modeling bimetallic catalytic systems for use in hydrogen fuel cells.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I went through my degree, I discovered that what I really liked about my research was the math behind it.
        What especially interested me was how calculations could be sped up through efficient algorithms,
        as well as what could be done to speed up calculations on supercomputers, like the TACC resources I had access to.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal</h2>
       
    <p>
        I used to be a DJ on KVRX 91.7 FM in Austin, Texas. I would occasionally play live around town as well.
        Electronic music is my specialty.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a coffee nerd. I'm excited by the amount of variables that you can change to get a different tasting cup.
        There's also the satisfaction of making it yourself, just how you like it.
    </p>

    <p>
        I studied abroad in Brighton, England at the University of Sussex in the spring of 2019. I kept a travel blog
        of my experiences.
